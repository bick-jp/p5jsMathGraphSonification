	    <h1>Sonification of a graph y equals x (y = x)</h1>
      <h2>Description of the graph</h2>
      <p>The graph is y equals x. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus five to plus five. The shape of the graph is a straight line with a slope of one. The graph begins at the point of x equals minus five and y equals minus five. As it moves to the right, the graph continues to increase, through the origin, until it reaches the point of x equals plus five and y equals plus five.</p>
      <h2>Description of sonification</h2>
      <p>You will hear the pitch constantly goes up from beginning to end.</p>
