      <h1>Sonification of a graph y equals minus x squared (y = -x^2)</h1>
      <h2>Description of the graph</h2>
      <p>The graph is y equals minus x squared. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus five to plus five. The shape of the graph is a parabola, concave down (i.e. similar to upside-down U-shape). The graph begins at the point of x equals minus five and y equals minus 25. As it moves to the right, the graph increases steeply till it reaches the maximum at the origin. Then the graph changes direction to go down steeply until it reaches the point of x equals plus five and y equals minus 25.</p>
