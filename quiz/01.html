      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>The graph has a jump discontinuity at x equals two.</p>

      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>The graph consists of two segments.</p>
      <p>The shape of the first segment is a parabola, concave down (i.e. similar to upside-down U-shape). It begins at the point of x equals minus five and y is about minus three. As it moves to the right, the graph increases slowly till it reaches the maximum at x equals zero and y equals two. Then the graph changes direction to go down until x equals two and y is about one.</p>
      <p>At x equals two, there is a jump discontinuity and y jumps from about one to minus two.</p>
      <p>The second segment begins at x is greater than but not equal to two and y is greate than but not equal to minus two. Its shape is a straight line with a slope of one. As it moves to the right, the graphs increases until it reaches the point of x equals five and y equals one.</p>
