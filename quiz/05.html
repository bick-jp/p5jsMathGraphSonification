      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>The graph has an inifinite discontinuity at x equals minus one, a jump discontinuity at x equals one, and a removable discontinuity at x equals four.</p>

      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>The graph consists of three segments.</p>
      <p>The first segment begins at x equals minus five and y is close to but smaller than one. As it moves to the right, the graph decreases very slowly at first, then it decreases steeply around x passes minus two and the y-value becomes infinitely small as x continues to approach minus one. That is the end of the first segment.</p>
      <p>There is an inifinite discontinuity at x equals minus one where the y-value is undefined.</p>
      <p>The second segment begins when x is larger than but very close to minus one and y-value is very small. As it moves to the right, the graph increases steeply at first until x is close to zero, then it increases slowly until it reaches the point x is close to one and y is close to one. That is the end of the second segment.</p>
      <p>There is a jump discontinuity at x equals one where the y-value jumps from one to three.</p>
      <p>The shape of the third segment is a straignt line with a slope of negative one. It begins at x equals one and y equals three. As it moves to the right, the graph decreases. There is a removable discontinuity at x equals four where the y-value becomes two, instead of zero, at the point. The graph continues to decrease until x equals five and y equals minus one. That is the end of the third segment.</p>
