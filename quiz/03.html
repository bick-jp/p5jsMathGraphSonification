      <h2>Answer</h2>
      <p>The graph has two jump discontinuities at x equals minus one and x equals two.</p>

      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>The graph consists of three segments.</p>
      <p>The first segment begins at x equals minus five and y is about minus one. Its shape is a parabola, concave down (i.e. similar to upside-down U-shape). As it moves to the right, the graph increases till it reaches the point of x equals minus three and y equals three. Then it decreases till x is close to and less than minus one and y is close to and less than minus one.</p>
      <p>There is a jump discontinuity at x equals minus one. The y-value jumps from about minus one to about three.</p>
      <p>The second segment begins at x equals minus one and y is about three. Its shape is a parabola, concave down. As it moves to the right, the graph increases at first till it reaches the point of x equals zero and y equals three. Then it decreases till x is close to and less than two one and y is about two.</p>
      <p>There is a jump discontinuity at x equals two. The y-value jumps from about minus two to minus one.</p>
      <p>The third segment begins at x equals two and y equals minus one. Its shape is a parabola, concave up. As it moves to the right, the graph decreases at first it reaches the point of x equals minus three and y equals minus three. Then it increases till x equals five and y equals five.</p>
