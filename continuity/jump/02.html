      <h1>Jump discontinuity example 2</h1>
      
      <h2>Description of the graph</h2>
      <p>The graph consists of two segments: y equals x squared when x is less than one, and y equals minus x plus four when x is greater than or equal to one. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus five to plus five.</p>
      <p>The shape of the first segment is a parabola, concave up (i.e. similar to U-shape). It begins at the point of x equals minus five and y equals 25. As it moves to the right, the graph decreases steeply till it reaches the minimum at the origin. Then the graph changes direction to go up until x is less than one.</p>
      <p>Then, the second segment begins at the point of x equals one and y equals three. The shape of the second segment is a straight line with a slope of minus one. As it moves to the right, the graph continues to decrease until it reaches the point of x equals five and y equals minus one.</p>

      <h2>Description of discontinuity</h2>
      <p>This graph is a case that there is a jump in the y-value when x equals one and the graph is divided into two segments. If a graph containts a jump and separates the graphs into multiple segments, it is called a jump discontinuity.</p>

      <h2>Description of sonification</h2>
      <p>When x equals one, you will hear the pitch goes high. Then it keeps going down as x increases.</p>
