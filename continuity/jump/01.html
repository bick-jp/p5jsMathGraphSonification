      <h1>Jump discontinuity example 1</h1>
      <h2>Description of the graph</h2>
      <p>The graph consists of two segments: y equals x when x is less than zero, and y equals x plus two when x is greater than or equal to one. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus five to plus five. The graph consists of two disjoint straight lines with a slope of one.</p>
      <p>The first segment begins at the point of x equals minus five and y equals minus five. As it moves to the right, the graph continues to increase with a slope of one till x equals less than zero.</p>
      <p>Then, the second segment begins at the point of x equals zero and y equals two. As it moves to the right, the graph continues to increase with a slope of one until it reaches the point of x equals five and y equals seven.</p>

      <h2>Description of discontinuity</h2>
      <p>This graph is a case that there is a jump in the y-value when x equals one and the graph is divided into two segments. If a graph containts a jump and separates the graphs into multiple segments, it is called a jump discontinuity.</p>

      <h2>Description of sonification</h2>
      <p>When x equals zero, you will hear the pitch goes high. Then it keeps going up as x increases.</p>
