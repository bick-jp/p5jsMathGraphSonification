      <h1>Removable discontinuity example 2</h1>

      <h2>Description of the graph</h2>
      <p>The graph consists of two segments: y equals x when x is not equal to one, and y equals two when x equals one. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus five to plus five. The shape of the graph is a straight line with a slope of one. The graph begins at the point of x equals minus five and y equals minus five. As it moves to the right, the graph continues to increase, through the origin, till x equals less than one. Then, when x equals one, the y-value becomes two. Then, when x is greater than one, the graphs continues to increase again until it reaches the point of x equals plus five and y equals plus five.</p>

      <h2>Description of discontinuity</h2>
      <p>This graph is a case that y has a discrete value at a point of x equals one (i.e. y becomes two instead of one, when x equals one). If a graph containts a descrete value at a point (i.e. the graph is not continuous), it is called a removable discontinuity.</p>

      <p>When x equals one, you will hear the pitch goes high once, then back to low again.</p>
